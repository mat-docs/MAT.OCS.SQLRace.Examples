# McLaren Applied **SQLRace API Sample Code**.

Collection of example code and best practices to use the SQLRace API.

The SQLRace API is used to read and write time-series data stored in supported database and file formats. It provides mechanisms for querying sessions, extracting and analysing data, statistical operations and custom defined maths functions, as well as recording live data.

SQLRace API is available as a Nuget package to registered users from the **[McLaren Applied Nuget Repository](https://github.com/mat-docs/packages)**.
